# Spotify Playlist Editor

The Spotify Playlist Editor is a node.js web application that allows Spotify users to rearrange tracks in their playlists online.

### But why?
Currently, the Android Spotify app doesn't allow you reorder tracks in your playlists - this must be carried out on the desktop application or iOS app.

## Configuration

Create an app at [Spotify Developer](https://developer.spotify.com/)

Modify the following part of the index.js file to include your client ID and client secret:

```
var client_id = 'CLIENT_ID_GOES_HERE'; // Your client id
var client_secret = 'CLIENT_SECRET_GOES_HERE'; // Your client secret
```

Once you have deployed your application, take a note of the URL and update the following part of the app.js file:

```
var redirect_uri = 'https://www.DEPLOYED_APP.com/callback';
```

Remember, OAuth requires that callback URLs are hosted using SSL, so ensure that you specify an "HTTPS" URL.

Make sure you then configure the same callback URL against your application at [Spotify Developer](https://developer.spotify.com/).
