# WARNING

Note: This version of the playlist editor was intended to be an experiment with jquery. This repository is now deprecated, please see alirawashdeh/spotify-playlist-editor for the new version which doesn't require javascript.

# Spotify Playlist Editor

The Spotify Playlist Editor is a node.js web application that allows Spotify users to rearrange tracks in their playlists online.

Currently hosted at [www.playlisteditor.com](www.playlisteditor.com)

### But why?
Currently, the Android Spotify app doesn't allow you reorder tracks in your playlists - this must be carried out on the desktop application or iOS app.

## Configuration

Log in to [Spotify Developer](https://developer.spotify.com/) and create an application.

Modify the following part of the index.js file to include the client ID and client secret of your application on Spotify Developer.

```
var client_id = 'CLIENT_ID_GOES_HERE'; // Your client id
var client_secret = 'CLIENT_SECRET_GOES_HERE'; // Your client secret
```

Once you have deployed your application, take a note of the URL and update the following part of the app.js file:

```
var redirect_uri = 'https://www.DEPLOYED_APP.com/callback';
```

Remember, OAuth requires that callback URLs are hosted using SSL, so ensure that you specify an "HTTPS" URL.

Make sure you then configure the same callback URL against your application at [Spotify Developer](https://developer.spotify.com/).
